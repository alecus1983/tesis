@article{Fila2007,
	abstract = {It is the responsibility of the distribution network operator (DNO) to maintain voltage profiles within statutory limits across a range of conditions such as varying load or intermittent output of distributed generation. An effective device for voltage control in distribution networks is the on-load transformer tap changer equipped with automatic voltage control (AVC) relays. In order to increase security of supply, it is common practise for the DNO to parallel transformers. A number of factors that can influence the optimum tap position are primary voltage level, load level, power factor, distributed generation and circulating current. This paper presents, firstly, an overview of automatic voltage control methods for paralleled transformers and related standard DNO practice. Secondly, a detailed description of the established transformer automatic paralleling package (TAPP) schemes is presented. Finally, modelling and analysis of the TAPP scheme is performed for a range of distribution network case studies in order to determine and evaluate the effect of the above factors on optimum tap position. Results from the modelling and analysis of the TAPP scheme and conclusions are also presented.},

abstract = {In this paper a novel coordinated voltage control scheme is proposed to enable voltage regulator to efficiently regulate the voltage of multiple feeders in the presence of DGs. The proposed technique is based on placing a remote terminal unit (RTUs) at each DG and each line capacitor. These RTUs coordinate together, through communication, and form a multiagent system. Detailed analysis is given for the estimation of the voltage profile based on the RTUs readings. The conditions under which the usage of one voltage regulator for the regulation of multiple-feeders fails are presented along with proposed solutions for such situation. Simulation results show that this technique enable a considerable increase in the allowed DG injected power to the system.},

The results of GQ-GA are compared with those given by the state-of-the-art evolutionary computational techniques such as enhanced GA, multi-objective evolutionary algorithm and particle swarm optimization algorithms, as well as the classical primal-dual interior-point optimal power flow algorithm.

@article{Emmanuel2017a,
abstract = {A plug-and-play connection of spatially distributed microgrids with renewable and non-renewable energy sources is one of the proposed descriptions of the evolving smart grid. Moreover, there is a gradual shift on distributed generation (DG) over the years to focus more on renewable generation due to global incentivization, climatic issues (such as greenhouse gas emission), and energy market deregulation. This article places attention on photovoltaic (PV) system as an emerging power generation paradigm enabled by the evolving smart grid. One of the critical constraints in this game-changing technology is the high propensity for a mismatch between its power output and load profile characteristics, which could result into severe voltage violations, high losses and a larger reverse power during low load conditions. Consequently, the concept of dispatchability with load-following function for various PV deployment scenarios is crucial for the 21st century grid modernization. The dispatchable PV unit output is controllable when deployed with storage systems making it suitable for ancillary services and demand-side management application. Also, dispatchability implies the ability to remotely start and stop the operation of PV unit when needed to maintain grid reliability. This article presents various deployment scenarios of dispatchable PV units and their impacts on the evolving smart grid. Additionally, this paper reviews the evolution of control, monitoring and communication systems in the active distribution network, utility-interactive inverter technologies, dispatchable grid-connected hybrid system deployments, and communication network configuration for dispatchable distributed energy resource (DER) units integration into the electric power system (EPS).},

abstract = {—This paper proposes a strategy for optimal integra-tion of battery energy storage systems (BESSs) to improve the load and distributed generation (DG) hosting ability of the utility grid. An effective tool that determines the optimal capacity and day-ahead operation strategy for deployment of distribution network operator (DNO)-controlled BESSs is presented. It is a cost-based multiobjective optimization strategy that considers two primary factors: 1) distribution system cost; and 2) battery cycling cost. Quantitative analyses on the benefits and tradeoffs of BESS instal-lations are carried out considering different service options. BESS is investigated for three main service options: 1) voltage regula-tion; 2) loss reduction; and 3) peak reduction. The performance and benefits of the optimized BESS to control one service option exclusively or multiple services simultaneously is compared. The analysis is further extended to study the effect of installation site on the size, management strategy, and the service option. Results show that optimal integration of BESSs can realize maximum operational and cost benefits while effectively elevating the load and DG hosting capability of the network. The approach is devel-oped using MATLAB interior-point algorithm. Simulations are conducted for the medium voltage (MV) IEEE 33 bus system and a low voltage (LV) distribution network in Western Australia studied during the Perth Solar City Trial.},

As far as the first aspect is concerned, the procedure is cyclically repeated at each time-step after that loads and renewable productions have been adjusted by means of real-time measurements. The economic aspects are performed by solving an optimization problem that minimizes the overall production cost and, therefore, it fixes the active power set point for all the programmable units. The Distribution System Operator (DSO) requirements in terms of active/reactive power management and voltage control, as requested by the majority of grid codes/standards, are satisfied (if possible) by tuning the reactive power of the programmable units. The proposed EMS has been applied and validated on University of Genoa Smart Polygeneration Microgrid (SPM) and it shows its efficacy in satisfying both the economic and power quality objectives.},

@article{Oshiro2010,
abstract = {In recent years, distributed generations based on natural energy or co-generation systems are increasing due to global warming and reduction of fossil fuels. Many of the distributed generations are set up in the vicinity of customers, with the advantage that this decreases transmission losses and transmission capacity. However, output power generated from renewable energy such as wind power and photovoltaics, is influenced by weather conditions. Therefore if the distributed generation increases with conventional control schemes, the voltage variation in a distribution system becomes a serious problem. In this paper, an optimal control method of distribution voltage with coordination of distributed installations, such as On Load Tap Changer (OLTC), Step Voltage Regulator (SVR), Shunt Capacitor (SC), Shunt Reactor (ShR), and Static Var Compensator (SVC), is proposed. In this research, the communication infrastructure is assumed to be widespread in the distribution network. The proposed technique combines genetic algorithm (GA) and Tabu search (TS) to determine the control operation. In order to confirm the validity of the proposed method, simulation results are presented for a distribution network model with distributed (photovoltaic) generation. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The voltage rise of the low voltage (LV) power distribution grid to which multiple solar photovoltaic (PV) systems are integrated is a critical technical problem that should be addressed. With PV systems that are integrated to the LV power distribution grid (with an R to X ratio greater than unity) via voltage source converters, the opportunity exists to regulate the respective point of common coupling (PCC) voltages by dynamically controlling the active and reactive power response of PV systems. In this paper, two closed-loop controllers that are able to regulate the PCC voltage by dynamically controlling the active and reactive power response of the PV system are presented. The design methodology is presented with considerable detail. The plant model of each controller is derived and the design procedure of each controller is explained in detail. By combining the dynamic active and reactive power controllers proposed in this paper, two novel operating strategies for PV systems, fixed minimum power factor operation and fixed maximum apparent power operation, are introduced. The latter operating strategy has been identified as the most efficient way of regulating the PCC voltage of a PV system. The simulation results and experimental validation confirm the accuracy of the derived plant models, the robustness of the designed controllers and the feasibility of implementing the proposed novel operating strategies in PV systems.},

abstract = {Power system security is vulnerable to cyber attacks that may cause significant damages to the power grid and result in huge financial losses. In this paper, we show the risks associated with cyber attacks and propose an artificial neural network-based protection approach. The proposed algorithm can monitor the output of power flow calculations and detect data anomalies in real-time. The network observability rules are formulated as a mixed integer linear program (MILP) problem. The results of the MILP problem are used to decrease the amount of data input required by the algorithm while the system stays observable. We run our experiments on the IEEE 24-bus reliability test system. The experimental results show that the developed algorithm is a promising enhancement to ensure data integrity in control centers. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {In this paper an analytical design method is proposed for constant voltage controlled inverter based DG with frequency dependent ZIP-Exponential static load model to obtain proper inverter output control and successful islanding detection. The proposed technique is aimed to eliminate the dependency of DG operation point on anti-islanding performance which is unavoidable in case of traditional control strategy. The generalized formulae are derived for calculating the upper and lower limits of the voltage gain, and it is recommended to select the voltage gain within the designed range for effective islanding detection. The proposed approach is tested in MATLAB/Simulink environment and result shows that the proposed scheme is found to be highly effective in islanding detection considering complex network configurations with single and multiple DG systems. The proposed control scheme is able to detect islanding within 10 ms (half cycle) from the event inception, showing the fastness of the developed technique. It is also observed that the percentage of voltage and current THD of the proposed scheme is within permissible limits, indicate that the power quality of the inverter is not degraded by the proposed control strategy, and thus overcomes the drawback of existing active anti-islanding techniques.},

@article{Sakar2016,
abstract = {— In this paper, the hosting (or maximum allowable) capacity of a photovoltaic (PV)-based distributed generation (DG) unit for a typical two bus distorted distribution system, is analyzed. The harmonic constraints, total and individual harmonic distortion limits stated in IEEE Standard 519, and the conventional hosting capacity constraints, bus rms voltage limit and the current carrying capability limit of the supply cables are taken into account. In the analysis, various simulations are carried out to show the effect of the nonlinearity degrees of the loads on the system's hosting capacity. It is clearly seen from the analysis results that the harmonic distortion limits significantly constrain the PV-based DG unit hosting capacity for the higher nonlinearity levels of the consumer. Accordingly, a C-type filter is designed to maximize the hosting capability of the studied system while providing desired power factor and satisfying the harmonic and conventional hosting capacity constraints. Besides, the numerical results are given to point out that a higher allowable hosting capacity is obtained with the proposed filter design approach compared to two traditional filter design approaches, which aims to attain minimization of voltage total harmonic distortion and minimization of current total demand distortion by considering the same constraints of the proposed approach. It is found that passive filters, already planned in the original system, helps in improving the PV-based DG hosting capacity of distribution feeder.},

abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of reactive power control of distributed generation (DG) units in the medium voltage (MV) distribution systems to maintain the system voltages within the predefined limits. An efficient approach for the load flow calculation is used here which is based on the topological structure of the network. It has been formulated for the radial distribution systems. A direct voltage sensitivity analysis method is developed in this paper which is also based on the topological structure of the network and independent of the network operating points. Thus, the sensitivity matrix is calculated once with the load flow program and it is used in all the system working conditions. The problem of DGs reactive power control is formulated as an optimization problem which uses the sensitivity analysis for linearizing the system around its operating points. The objective of the optimization problem is to return the system voltages inside the permitted range by using the reactive power of DGs in an optimal way. The optimal solutions are obtained by implementing particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. Then, the results are verified by running a load flow considering new values of DGs reactive power. The procedure is repeated as long as a voltage violation is observed. Simulation results reveal that the proposed algorithm is capable of keeping the system voltages within the permitted limits.},

@article{Arghandeh2016,
abstract = {Modern society relies heavily upon complex and widespread electric grids. In recent years, advanced sensors, intelligent automation, communication networks, and information technologies (IT) have been integrated into the electric grid to enhance its performance and efficiency. Integrating these new technologies has resulted in more interconnections and interdependencies between the physical and cyber components of the grid. Natural disasters and man-made perturbations have begun to threaten grid integrity more often. Urban infrastructure networks are highly reliant on the electric grid and consequently, the vulnerability of infrastructure networks to electric grid outages is becoming a major global concern. In order to minimize the economic, social, and political impacts of large-scale power system outages, the grid must be resilient in addition of being robust and reliable. The concept of a power system's cyber-physical resilience centers around maintaining critical functionality of the system backbone in the presence of unexpected extreme disturbances. Resilience is a multidimensional property of the electric grid; it requires managing disturbances originating from physical component failures, cyber component malfunctions, and human attacks. In the electric grid community, there is not a clear and universally accepted definition of cyber-physical resilience. This paper focuses on the definition of resilience for the electric grid and reviews key concepts related to system resilience. This paper aims to advance the field not only by adding cyber-physical resilience concepts to power systems vocabulary, but also by proposing a new way of thinking about grid operation with unexpected extreme disturbances and hazards and leveraging distributed energy resources. The concepts of service availability and quality are not new, but many recognize the need of resilience in maintaining essential services to critical loads, for example to allow home refrigerators to operate for food conservation in the aftermath of a hurricane landfall. By providing a comprehensive definition of power system resilience, this paper paves the way for creating appropriate and effective resilience standards and metrics.},

In the AM operation mode, the distribution network equipment is controlled in real time based on the real-time measurements of system parameters (voltage and current). The proposed model determines the optimal size, location and time of investment of DG units. The uncertainty of energy price and rate of load growth is handled using a scenario-based modelling approach. To demonstrate the advantages of dynamic DG planning, its results are compared with those of static model. Also the results of optimal DG planning in active network are compared with those of the passive operation mode. In addition, a technical evaluation and comparison between conventional, passive and active networks have been performed. The proposed model is successfully applied to the 33-bus radial distribution network. The results indicate that using AM, the cost function and losses are decreased effectively compared to the passive management. Computation of the optimal DG planning in AM environment is formulated as a mixed integer non-linear problem which can be solved using commercial optimisation packages like as GAMS.},

abstract = {—The electric energy demand will increase in the future, and the will to exploit larger amounts of gener-ation from renewable resources requires the development of new strategies to manage a more complex electrical system. Different techniques allow the smart management of distribution networks such as load shifting, peak shav-ing, and short-term optimization. This work aims to test, in a real low-voltage (LV) active network (LV test facility of Strathclyde University of Glasgow), a Microgrid Smart Energy Management System, which adopts a two-stage strategy. The two levels of the proposed energy control sys-tem are composed of: 1) midterm controller that, according to weather, load, and generation forecasts, computes the profile of the controllable resources (generation, load, and storage), the dispatch problem is then solved through an optimization process; and through 2) short-term controller, which controls the power absorption of the active net-work. This procedure is hierarchically designed to dispatch the resources/loads, according to priority signals with the objective to contain the energy consumption below pre-determined thresholds. The scalability and effectiveness of the architecture, which is validated in a real test bed, demonstrates the feasibility of implementing such a type of controller directly connected to the LV breakers, delivering a part of a real smart grid.},

abstract = {This article proposes a control architecture for a low-voltage AC microgrid with distributed battery energy storage. The droop controlled inverters interact with the microgrid through the RL combination of their virtual resistive output impedance with the series impedance of a coupling transformer. To obtain independent association of frequency with active power, and voltage with reactive power, decoupled droop control techniques are proposed and analyzed. The resulting control can be adjusted for appropriate dynamic response without modifying the droop coefficients. The application in the microgrid in diverse operating conditions is verified by a detailed simulation. The resulting primary control layer offers the capability of being easily actuated from a secondary control layer for procedures such as flexible power dispatching and frequency restoration. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The development of distribution networks for participation in active network management (ANM) and smart grids is introduced using the microgrid concept. In recent years, this issue has been researched and implemented by many experts. The second part of this paper describes those developed operational concepts of microgrids that have an impact on their participation in ANM and in the requirements for achieving targets. Power quality is the most challenging task in microgrids, especially when the system switches from normal parallel operation (grid-connected mode) to island operation. Indeed, following planned or unplanned transitions to island mode, microgrids may develop instability. For this reason, the paper addresses the principles behind island-detection methods, black-start operation, fault management, and protection systems, along with a comprehensive review of power quality. Finally, island detection and the other topics are summarized with a flowchart and tables. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Aging transmission and substation infrastructure linking military bases to commercial utility power coupled with aging distribution systems inside the base threatens installation mission readiness. Traditionally, the practice of providing critical facility power contingency has been to install building-dedicated engine generators. However, the presence of these units provides a false sense of security because actual reliability is reduced due to sub-optimal and intermittent loading. A major energy challenge for military installations is to improve their energy security while conforming to Assistant Chief of Staff for Installation Management requirements (mandating reduced economic and environmental impact of installation energy). This report provides a technical explanation of the power electronic and control response challenges associated with the design of an autonomous military installation scalable power system capable of operating independently from the commercial grid for extended periods of time in an emergency. Rather than providing power only to pre-determined mission essential facilities, the micro grid will give the mission commander the ability to dynamically designate and prioritize which facilities receive available power. Implementing a scalable power grid will assure significant enhancement of mission readiness, and as a direct consequence, intelligent system control will enable base personnel to quantify the state of mission readiness.},

Until now the most used configuration has been the ac microgrid, but dc-based microgrids are gaining interest due to the advantages they provide over their counterpart (no reactive power, no synchronization, increasing number of dc devices, etc.). Therefore, hybrid ac/dc microgrids are raising as an optimal approach as they combine the main advantages of ac and dc microgrids. This paper reviews the most interesting topologies of hybrid ac/dc microgrids based on the interconnection of the ac and dc networks and the conventional power network. After performing a description and analysis of each configuration, a comparative evaluation has been performed to highlight the most important features of each one. The future trends identified during the study also show that several features such as the scalability, modeling or design require further research towards the integration of hybrid microgrids in the power network.},

We also show that such convergence can be achieved while respecting constraints on voltage magnitude and branch angle differences. The controller is robust under various contingency scenarios, including loss of communication links and failures of DERs. The proposed controller is applicable to lossy mesh microgrids with heterogeneous R/X distribution lines and reasonable parameter variations.

abstract = {Abstract The conventional approach for the control of distribution networks, in the presence of active generation and/or controllable loads and storage, involves a combination of both frequency and voltage regulation at different time scales. With the increased penetration of stochastic resources, distributed generation and demand response, this approach shows severe limitations in both the optimal and feasible operation of these networks, as well as in the aggregation of the network resources for upper-layer power systems. An alternative approach is to directly control the targeted grid by defining explicit and real-time setpoints for active/reactive power absorptions/injections defined by a solution of a specific optimization problem; but this quickly becomes intractable when systems get large or diverse. In this paper, we address this problem and propose a method for the explicit control of the grid status, based on a common abstract model characterized by the main property of being composable. That is to say, subsystems can be aggregated into virtual devices that hide their internal complexity. Thus the proposed method can easily cope with systems of any size or complexity. The framework is presented in this Part I, whilst in Part II we illustrate its application to a CIGR?? low voltage benchmark microgrid. In particular, we provide implementation examples with respect to typical devices connected to distribution networks and evaluate of the performance and benefits of the proposed control framework.},

abstract = {In the distributed generation environment, parallel operated inverters play a key role in interfacing renewable energy sources with the grid or forming a grid. This can be achieved by operating the inverters in parallel with an effective control strategy. Hence, qualitative output in terms of voltage and power in a parallel inverter demands a control strategy for abating the certain performance parameters. The technical constraints like load sharing capability, stability, total harmonic distortion, steady state and transient response determines the performance indices of the control strategy in connection with micro grid. The paper presents a comprehensive review of control strategies of parallel inverter based on the communication and control loops. The classification and transfiguration of control strategy from centralized approach to distributed approach and from distributed approach to droop approach were reviewed in the paper. The paper also focuses on the ancillary services that improve the performance indices of the system with multi loop approach of droop control in connection to micro grid. This paper provides an insight of the researcher's perception in emphasizing the power quality issues to achieve regulated and qualitative output with different control strategies. The paper also cites the progress of the research on parallel inverter control by inoculating the issue and the resolution in the literature. This could help the future researchers in addressing the power quality issues associated with parallel inverter control in connection to micro grid. Based on the reviewed state of art, the paper finally reports the suitability and future scope of the control strategy as its concluding remark.},

abstract = {Majority of the wind power resources are typically sited at remote locations in power networks and generated power is transmitted through rural transmission corridors to load centres. With increased penetration level of the wind generation there is an increased requirement to provide ancillary services from distributed wind power resources, hence they are operated under different control strategies to provide ancillary services to the network. The control strategies and capability characteristics will significant impact on voltage fluctuations in distribution networks. This paper presents a comparative analysis between different wind generator control strategies (i.e. power factor control strategy, voltage control strategy and reactive power dispatch strategy) on network voltage fluctuations during variable wind conditions while considering extended reactive power capability (i.e. with both generator and power electronic converter reactive power capabilities) for the doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG). Voltage fluctuations are analysed using real wind data measured at a DFIG based wind farm, and the wind farm model was verified against real measurements. Study has shown that voltage fluctuations are exacerbated when wind generator is at mode transition (i.e. from power optimisation mode to power limitation mode). A sensitivity analysis has shown that voltage fluctuations are exacerbated due to the limitations of the reactive power capability of the DFIG, and the operating point of the DFIG power curve irrespective of the control strategy implemented at the wind generator. Furthermore, a mitigation strategy was developed as an integrated control scheme to the main control scheme in order to reduce voltage fluctuations due to wind power variations. However, effectiveness of the mitigation strategy is greatly affected by the reactive power capability of the DFIG, in particular during high wind turbulences. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {This paper is concerned with a local regulation of the voltage profiles at buses where wind power distributed generators are connected. In particular, the aim of the work is to compare two voltage control methods: the first based on a sensitivity analysis and the second on the designing of a fuzzy control system. The two methods are tested by means of simulations on a real distribution system and the results indicate that both methods allow the voltage profiles to be regulated at the wind generator connection bus within voltage standard limits, by taking into account the capability curves of the wind generators. Nevertheless, the fuzzy method presents more advantage in comparison with the sensitivity method. In fact, (i) it provides a gentler action control with a lower reactive power consumption during control operations as the reactive power profile follows better the voltage variations; (ii) the design of the fuzzy controller is independent from the knowledge of network parameters and its topology. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.

In this transition, distributed energy resources (DERs) may introduce some problems, such as intermittent features, but could also play an important role on accommodating the intermittence and assisting system operation. A proper aggregation and coordination scheme of DER units is required to enable the flexibility provision in an economical and efficient manner. In the meanwhile, nondistruptive control of the units is essential to guarantee their long-term active participation. In addition, a newly established system should also allow and coordinate other controllable grid facilities. This paper proposes a hierarchical operating framework for DER units and controllable grid assets in a market environment. Voltage regulation as a common distributed system service is used for case study. The necessity of the coordination between DER units and the grid facilities, e.g., on-load tap-changer (OLTC), is addressed.},

The dynamics of the system is analyzed with the step change in inputs applied in both reactive load demand and wind speed. The analysis is focused on the voltage and reactive power control of the hybrid power system using reactive capability of the load side converter (LSC) of DFIG. When the reactive load and thereby the terminal voltage deviates by a small amount, the LSC works as a reactive power generator.

The application of SOPs can improve the controllability of distribution systems, thus further enhances the economy, flexibility and reliability of the grid. In this paper, considering the long-term operation characteristics of distributed generation, a mixed integer non-linear optimization problem is formulated to optimally determine the siting and sizing of SOPs based on the typical operation scenarios generated by Wasserstein distance. It is then transformed to and solved as a mixed integer second-order programming model. Finally, case studies on the IEEE 33-node system and Taiwan Power Company distribution system are used to verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method.},

abstract = {The aim of this research study has been to design a Hybrid Power System (HPS) which works with biogas and whose main components are a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC), a Gas microTurbine (GT), and a module of SuperCapacities (SCs). The HPS is the only power source of a rural isolated microgrid. Its structure, operating strategy, and controller have been designed considering the following criteria: efficiency, power quality, SOFC lifetime and robustness in stability and performance. The HPS structure includes a unique power converter, a 3-Level Neutral Point Clamped (3LNPC) inverter that connects the HPS to the AC microgrid. Regarding the selected operating strategy, it consists in regulating the SOFC power output to its rated value. Thus, the SCs and the GT must respond to the power demand variations. On the other hand, a study of the HPS shows that its dynamic behavior is not linear. Therefore, a special attention is put on designing a robust HPS controller. The control model is identified and the robust digital controller is designed using the "Tracking and Regulation with Independent Objectives" method. Simulation and experimental results show how the proposed structure, operating strategy, and controller allow ensuring a good behavior of the HPS from the point of view of the abovementioned four criteria.},

In this work we propose a signal processing technique capable of identifying and characterizing the number of capacitor banks connected to a standard North-American feeder circuit. The way the technique is applied allows a real-time remote monitoring of their operation, automatically identifying the switching activity for each capacitor bank connected. The technique is based on an unsupervised clustering of the three phase reactance step magnitudes. We demonstrate that using only passive monitoring of conventional substation bus PTs and feeder CTs, without any communication, nor visual inspection, to individual banks, it is possible to predict the number of capacitor banks on the distribution feeder and track their performance and activity over time. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {This paper presents a new method to speed up the solving process of the optimal coordinated voltage control (OCVC) problem. To this end, after occurrence of a fault, the power system is initially partitioned into interior, boundary and exterior zones by spectral graph partitioning method. Partitioning is based on the fact that voltage instability just after the fault, is a local phenomenon, therefore the variation of boundary and exterior variables is smaller than that of interior ones. Then, the equations of boundary and exterior zones are linearized, the algebraic variables and equations of exterior zone are removed and a considerable decrease in the number of power system equations is obtained which is equal to a reduction in the system dimensions. As a result the determination process of the optimal control actions is fastened. Also, based on the monotonic behavior of long-term voltages, a new method of predicting voltage trajectory is proposed, in which two points are used: the first point referring to the system state just after applying the control actions, which is called jumping point and the final one referring to the steady state of the system. In a case study on the New England 39-bus power system, it was verified that using this method a remarkable increase in calculation speed can be obtained while retaining the system precision.},

abstract = {Distribution feeder reconfiguration (DFR) is one of the well-known and effective strategies adopted in distribution network. The goal of DFR problem is to obtain a new topological structure for distribution feeders by rearranging the status of switches such that an optimal configuration would be obtained. The existence of Distributed Generation (DG) can affect the entire power system and especially distribution networks. This paper presents an efficient approach for multi-objective DFR problem considering the simultaneous effect of DG units. The objective functions to be investigated are 1) power losses, 2) voltage deviation of buses, 3) emission produced by DG units and distribution companies and 4) the total cost of the active power generated by DG units and distribution companies. The new evolutionary method is based on an efficient multi-objective hybrid honey bee mating optimization (HBMO) and shuffled frog leaping algorithm (SFLA) called MHBMO-SFLA. The proposed hybrid algorithm integrates the outstanding characteristics of SFLA to improve the performance of HBMO algorithm sufficiently. In the proposed MHBMO-SFLA, an external repository is considered to save non-dominated solutions which are found during the search process. Also, since the objective functions are not the same, a fuzzy clustering technique is utilized to control the size of the repository within the limits. A distribution test feeder is considered to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach. {\textcopyright} Shiraz University.},

These reserves are continuously regulated in order to match the generation and consumption in the system and thus, to maintain a constant electrical frequency. They are usually provided by synchronized conventional generating units such as hydraulic or thermal power plants. With the progressive displacement of these generating plants by non-synchronized renewable-based power plants (e.g. wind and solar) the net level of synchronous power reserves in the system becomes reduced. Therefore, wind power plants are required, according to some European Grid Codes, to also provide power reserves like conventional generating units do.

The double Synchronous reference frame method is used with a filter-based extraction to yield values of each sequence component. A distributed finite control set-model predictive control (DFCS-MPC) is extended and applied to control both sequences with one cost function. In this way the use of any parameters tuning, as in the classical PI controller is eliminated. The method exhibits features of the powerful MPC approach. Since an island mode is assumed, voltage and current control strategies are used. Power quality at the point of coupling is considerably improved by setting the voltage negative sequence component to zero in the cost function and nullifying the negative sequence current share of the relevant voltage-creating converter. Cases corresponding to different sharing conditions are studied. The validity of the proposed approach is verified under all considered conditions.},

abstract = {Increasing integration of renewable energy sources in the power grid leads to a complete re-thinking of its operation. This necessitates the consideration of new modeling and analysis approaches, which can serve as natural starting points for robust and scalable control and design strategies. In this 'vision' paper we will highlight two topics within the broad area of power networks: the modeling and analysis of the synchronous generator, and the modeling and analysis of power networks using the swing equation as an approximate model for the generator. In both cases we will discuss a port-Hamiltonian formulation, which reflects the underlying physics of power flow and energy storage. Although the port-Hamiltonian model of the synchronous generator reveals a clear structure it still poses fundamental challenges for its non-zero steady state stability analysis. It is shown how the swing equation can be directly deduced from the power balance of the port-Hamiltonian model of the synchronous generator. Under the phasor assumption, this leads to a port-Hamiltonian model of power networks of generators, which enables a straightforward stability analysis and provides a starting point for control.},

abstract = {The first part of this work introduced a control architecture for a low-voltage AC microgrid with distributed battery energy storage working in isolated mode. A primary control layer, based on applying decoupled droop control methods to the inverters, was proposed and analyzed, demonstrating its capability to share power and keep frequency and voltage within prescribed ranges under load changes. This second part of the work extends the analysis of the primary control actuation and proposes a secondary control layer, supported over a communications network, to add improvements such as local reactive power dispatching and nominal frequency and voltage restoration. ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract      = {The introduction of microgrids in distribution networks based on power electronics facilitates the use of renewable energy resources, distributed generation (DG) and storage systems while improving the quality of electric power and reducing losses thus increasing the performance and reliability of the electrical system. The hierarchical control structure, which consists of primary, secondary, and tertiary levels for microgrids that mimic the behavior of the mains grid, is reviewed. The main objective of this article is to give a description of state of the art for distributed power generation systems (DPGS) based on renewable energy and explore the power converters connected in parallel to the grid which are distinguished by their contribution to the formation of the grid voltage and frequency and are accordingly classified in three classes. This analysis is extended focusing mainly on the three classes of configurations: grid-forming, grid-feeding, and grid-supporting. The article ends up with an overview and a discussion of the control structures and strategies to control distribution power generation system (DPGS) units connected to the network.},

abstract = {National Grid, the UK Transmission System Operator (TSO) has metered frequent voltage rise excursions at 275-400 kV network since 2011-12, particularly during the minimum demand periods. This rise in system voltage is more severe in the areas with high penetration of underground cables. The steep decline in the reactive power demand in the last few years is the potential cause behind this voltage rise issue. Currently there is no responsibility of Distribution Network Operators (DNOs) to manage the reactive power exchanges at Transmission/Distribution interfaces i.e. at Grid Supply Points (GSPs), however soon to be implemented European Demand Connection Code (ENTSO-E) will make it obligatory for DNOs to limit these exchanges to 0MVar at GSPs during minimum demand periods for a loading below 25{\%} of the peak MW demand at the GSPs. The enforcement of this code is helpful for the National Grid to maintain voltage levels within the statutory limits; on the however this will have a negative impact in the business case of DNOs, who will have to make costly investments for the installation of reactive power compensation equipment. This work proposes an Active Network Management (ANM) approach to limit the reactive power export to National Grid by using the Power Factor Control (PFC) of Distributed Generation (DG) and Demand Side Management (DSM) as control variables in a multi-period Optimal Power Flow (OPF) framework},

abstract = {Proliferation of grid-connected photovoltaic systems (PVSs) causes technical problems due to their variable and non-dispatchable generated power. High penetration of PVS in distribution networks can result in overvoltage in some operating conditions. Although this situation occurs rarely, it limits the installed capacity of PVS. In this paper, adaptive droop-based control algorithms are presented to regulate active and reactive power of PVS, with the objectives of loss minimization and increasing the PVS capacity installation without unallowable overvoltage. Operating voltage range of the PVS is divided into several intervals, and a specific control algorithm is presented for each of them. Reactive power control of PVS is used as the first action, and active power curtailment as the final remedy for voltage rise prevention. The proposed adaptive droop-based algorithms make the system operation smooth and highly stable. The required active power curtailment is shared equally between all PVSs, so that they have equal opportunity to sell their extra generation. Decentralized control with only local measurements is the other feature of the proposed methods. Efficiency of the proposed methods is demonstrated through simulation of different scenarios on the IEEE 33-bus distribution network.},

abstract = {A novel local voltage control is proposed where each voltage controller of a generating unit is equipped with additional coordinative voltage controller (CVC), which incorporates intelligent control into the power system. The controllers use artificial neural networks (ANN), trained on a large set of power system states. Optimal power flow (OPF) results serve as the optimal target in the ANN training process. All data the controller needs for operation are acquired locally. The proposed ANN voltage control maintains a sub-optimal power system voltage profile and reduces the power system losses. When equipped with ANN controllers, the system responds satisfactorily to changes in the power system topology, thus improving the power system security. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

abstract = {This paper presents a risk-based advanced distribution network management system (NMS) aimed at maximizing wind energy harvesting while simultaneously managing congestion and voltages. The NMS allows the adoption of multi-minute control cycles so the volume of actions from on-load tap changers (OLTCs) and distributed generation (DG) plants can be reduced while effectively catering for the effects of wind power uncertainties. This work presents the quantification of benefits and impacts from adopting different control cycles as well a comparison with a deterministic approach. The risk-based approach is implemented by adapting and expanding an AC optimal power flow. A risk level is used to determine the extent to which congestion and voltage rise could exist during a control cycle. The proposed NMS is applied to a real-life U.K. MV network from the North West of England to assess its effectiveness in managing high penetration of wind power considering minute-by-minute simulations for one week. The results show that the risk-based approach can effectively manage network constraints better than the deterministic approach, particularly for multi-minute control cycles, reducing also the number of control actions but at the expense of higher levels of curtailment.},

abstract = {The distributed generator (DG) has a huge economical and environmental potential, especially if it is based on renewable energy sources (RESs). It is very important for the future development of smart grids. However, high penetration of DGs into distribution systems can cause voltage deviations beyond the statutory range, and reverse power flow toward the substation transformer. Consequently, it can increase the distribution system losses if it is not well supervised. Thus, in order to meet smart grid objectives, DGs have to be controlled in coordination with other power resources existing in the distribution system. Controllable loads (CLs) can also help in promoting smart grids through demand response (DR) application. Therefore, this paper proposes a decision technique of an optimal reference schedule for DGs, battery energy storage system (BESS), CLs, and tap changing transformers. The main objective of the proposed optimization problem is to achieve loss reduction in the distribution system. However, other aims such as voltage control and power flow smoothing have been achieved. The optimization is performed based on predicted values of load demand and DG generation. Simulations are conducted for one operation day to illustrate the optimality of the proposed scheduling method and to assess the impact of CLs in smart grids.},

In this case, the problem faced by a Generation Company (GenCo) is that of maximizing the revenues from participating in the market through the pool auction while honoring the bilateral contracts agreed, for which the revenue is fixed. The extension to mixed markets of a medium-term model, successfully employed for auction-only markets, is presented. It results in a non-convex expected revenue function to be maximized subject to constraints, for which the currently available direct global-optimization solvers prove not to be efficient enough. A heuristic procedure based on a sequence of solutions by a nonlinear solver is presented, and numerical results obtained with several realistic cases show satisfactory results. The test cases presented have dispatchable and non-dispatchable renewables and consider medium-term pumping together with conventional units by all GenCos participating in the mixed market.

abstract = {One of the main aims of the System Operator (SO) is to maintain in every moment the system parameters between feasible operational margins. In certain periods of the day the load suffers fast changes which cause, specially when it tends to increase, a generalized voltage decrement and a more stressed condition for many reactive resources. In such cases, many devices may arrive to their operational limits, situation which translates into a weaker system. To avoid this negative effect the control variables should be rescheduled to maintain the normal operation conditions in the foreseeable future. This work proposes a useful tool to assist the SO when determining such actions. The main improvements are due to the implementation of a hybrid method that allows the comparison of different kinds of control variables and the inclusion of the operator background and experience in the algorithm that determines the actions. The performance of the proposed method is tested in both the IEEE 14-Bus and 118-Bus test systems. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Control strategies of distributed generation (DG) are investigated for different combination of DG and storage units in a microgrid. This paper develops a detailed photovoltaic (PV) array model with maximum power point tracking (MPPT) control, and presents real and reactive power (PQ) control and droop control for DG system for microgrid operation. In grid-connected mode, PQ control is developed by controlling the active and reactive power output of DGs in accordance with assigned references. In islanded mode, DGs are controlled by droop control. Droop control implements power reallocation between DGs based on predefined droop characteristics whenever load changes or the microgrid is connected/disconnected to the grid, while the microgrid voltage and frequency is maintained at appropriate levels. This paper presents results from a test microgrid system consisting of a voltage source converter (VSC) interfacing with a DG, a PV array with MPPT, and changeable loads. The control strategies are tested via two scenarios: the first one is to switch between grid-connected mode and islanded mode and the second one is to change loads in islanded mode. Through voltage, frequency, and power characteristics in the simulation under such two scenarios, the proposed control strategies can be demonstrated to work properly and effectively.},

The aim of these control strategies is to limit the voltage rise, caused by a high local photovoltaic power feed-in and hence allow additional photovoltaic capacity to be connected to the mains. Autonomous inverter control strategies, which do not require any kind of data communication between the inverter and its environment, as well as an on-load tap changer for distribution transformers, is investigated. The technical and economical assessment of these strategies is derived from 12-month root mean square (rms) simulations, which are based on a real low voltage grid and measured dc power generation values. The results show that the provision of reactive power is an especially effective way to increase the hosting capacity of a low voltage grid for photovoltaic systems.},

abstract = {With the increasing share of renewable energy sources (RES) in demand supply, the distribution network operators (DNOs) are facing with new challenges. In one hand, it is desirable to increase the ability of the network in absorbing more renewable power generation units (or increasing the hosting capacity (HC)). On the other hand, power injection to the distribution network by renewable resources may increase the active power losses (if not properly allocated) which reduces the efficiency of the network. Thus, the DNO should make a balance between these two incommensurate objective functions. The Demand Response (DR) in context of smart grids can be used by DNO to facilitate this action. This paper provides an approach in which a multi-objective and multi-period NLP optimization model is formulated where the DR is utilized as an effective tool to increase HC and decrease the energy losses simultaneously. In order to quantify the benefits of the proposed method, it is applied on a 69-bus distribution network. The numerical results substantiate that the proposed approach gives optimal locations and capacity of RES, as well as minimum energy losses by load shifting capability provided via DR programs.},

abstract = {Technical innovation in power distribution networks is pointing toward a decentralized control vision to deal with the issues in design and operations related to distributed energy resources. Thus, decentralized approaches to power flow management (PFM) are of significant importance from the distributed network operator (DNO) perspective. In this paper, a new hybrid distributed control approach is proposed to deal with thermal overload issues. The control algorithm is based on constraint satisfaction problem that is applied to solve the network constraint problem. The novelty of this control approach consists in the joint control of both distributed generation and demand response units for PFM in an autonomous regional control environment. The implementation of this demand-side management, integrated active network management, and distributed control technique contributes to network reinforcement deferral, economy of supply, and efficient capital expenditure. Simulation has been implemented in a medium voltage interconnected test network with a substation controller and a network simulator. The control actions successfully achieve the desired objectives and are evaluated in comparison analysis. This new hybrid distributed control technique has potential to benefit the DNO planning and operation activities in the development of future decentralized smart grids.},

@article{Samadi2014,
abstract = {High penetrations of photovoltaic (PV) systems in distribution grids have caused new challenges such as reverse power flow and voltage rise. Reactive power contribution by PV systems has been proposed by grid codes and literature as one of the remedies for voltage profile violation. Recent German Grid Codes (GGC), for instance, introduce a standard active power dependent reactive power characteristic, Q(P), for inverter-coupled distributed generators. Nevertheless, the GGC recommends a voltage dependent reactive power characteristic Q(V) for the near future, recognizing that the Q(P) characteristic cannot explicitly address voltage limits. This study utilizes the voltage sensitivity matrix and quasi-static analysis in order to develop a coordinated Q(V) characteristic for each PV system along a radial feeder using only the local measurement and drooping technique concepts. The aim of this paper is using a multi-objective design to adjust the parameters of the Q(V) characteristic in the proposed droop-based voltage regulation in order to minimize the reactive power consumption and line losses. On the other hand, it is also possible to adjust the parameters in order to reach equal reactive power sharing among all PV systems. A radial test distribution grid, which consist of five PV systems, is used to calculate power flow and, in turn, the voltage sensitivity matrix. The comparison of results demonstrates that both approaches in the proposed droop-based voltage regulation can successfully regulate the voltage to the steady-state limit. Moreover, it is shown that the profile of reactive power consumption and line losses are considerably reduced by the multi-objective design. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Microgrids can operate in both grid-connected mode and islanded mode. In order to smooth transfer from islanded mode to grid-connected mode, it is necessary to synchronize the point of common coupling (PCC) with main utility grid (UG) in voltage frequency, phase and amplitude. Conventional synchronization methods based on centralized communication are very costly and not suitable for multi-bus microgrids that have a large number of distributed generators (DGs). To address this concern, this study presents an active synchronization control strategy based on distributed cooperation technology for multi-bus microgrids. The proposed method can reconnect the microgrid in island to UG seamlessly with sparse communication channels. Synchronization correction signals are generated by a voltage controller, which are only transmitted to the leader DGs. Meanwhile, each DG exchanges information with its neighbors. Finally, the voltage of PCC will synchronize with the main grid and all DGs will achieve the consensus behaviors. Compared with traditional synchronization methods, the proposed method does not need complex communication networks and improves flexibility and redundancy. Even if the distributed communication breaks down, the primary droop control can still operate robustly. Small signal model of entire system is developed to adjust the parameters of distributed active synchronization controller. Simulation results are presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

abstract = {The deep integration of renewable energy resources, including solar photovoltaic (PV) and wind turbine (WT) energy, mainly depend on the inexpensive technological improvement of global emissions and the precise techniques for power quality. Grid-connected inverters act as key components in distributed generation systems for cutting-edge technology. The inverter connects the renewable energy sources and power distribution network systems for the conversion of power. In grid-connected systems, several current and voltage harmonics affect the system performances. Likewise, highly unstable devices coupled with the growing demand for nonlinear loads and renewable energy resources influence the power networks and systems performance in terms of power quality. The effective solutions to these problems are passive filters (PFs), static var generators, and active power filters (APFs). However, the use of PFs in a high-power system increases its cost, size, and weight. This study aims to assess the most advanced APFs by reducing the number of power switches and focus on the reduction of cost, size, and weight of grid-connected inverters. Several studies compared and evaluated reduced-switch-count APF inverter topologies, such as AC–AC, back-to-back, and common leg, under the single-phase and three-phase systems. Recently, cost-effective solutions to reduce the number of components, transformerless inverters, multilevel and multifunctional inverters based on the APF in PV, and wind energy conversion systems have been greatly explored. The current techniques and their limitations for developing advanced inverter-based devices for renewable energy systems are discussed with justifications. Therefore, this review would potentially help industrial researchers improve power quality in PV and WT energies and power distribution network systems.},

abstract = {With the increasing penetration levels of intermittent and fluctuating energy sources such as wind generating systems in the electricity grid, resulting voltage fluctuations and flicker can be expected to become an important power quality considerations. Due to significant bidirectional power flows resulting from large renewable power generation systems connected to downstream, voltage fluctuations may propagate from downstream to upstream. The work presented in this paper investigates and characterises flicker emission and propagation resulting from fluctuating generating sources connected to a distribution network. Mathematical models are developed for flicker emission under different generator control strategies and flicker propagation to upstream network. These emission and propagation characteristics are investigated and verified using a test network comprised of a wind farm. The study has revealed that flicker emission characteristics are influenced in a detrimental manner by the reactive power control strategy of the generator and the flicker attenuation characteristics are influenced by the various load types connected to the distribution feeder. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {National Grid, the UK Transmission System Operator (TSO) has metered frequent voltage rise excursions at 275-400 kV network since 2011-12, particularly during the minimum demand periods. This rise in system voltage is more severe in the areas with high penetration of underground cables. The steep decline in the reactive power demand in the last few years is the potential cause behind this voltage rise issue. Currently there is no responsibility of Distribution Network Operators (DNOs) to manage the reactive power exchanges at Transmission/Distribution interfaces i.e. at Grid Supply Points (GSPs), however soon to be implemented European Demand Connection Code (ENTSO-E) will make it obligatory for DNOs to limit these exchanges to 0MVar at GSPs during minimum demand periods for a loading below 25{\%} of the peak MW demand at the GSPs. The enforcement of this code is helpful for the National Grid to maintain voltage levels within the statutory limits; on the however this will have a negative impact in the business case of DNOs, who will have to make costly investments for the installation of reactive power compensation equipment. This work proposes an Active Network Management (ANM) approach to limit the reactive power export to National Grid by using the Power Factor Control (PFC) of Distributed Generation (DG) and Demand Side Management (DSM) as control variables in a multi-period Optimal Power Flow (OPF) framework},

However, the reconfiguration technique can only do this up to a certain point. Further power loss reduction may be realized via the application of Distributed Generation (DG). However, the integration of DG into the distribution system at a non-optimal location may result in increased power losses and voltage fluctuations. Therefore, a strategy for the selection of optimal placement and sizing of the DG needs to be developed and at the same time ensure optimal configuration. Many heuristic and artificial intelligence methods have been proposed in the literature for optimal distribution network reconfiguration, DGs sizing, and location. This paper reviews some of the more recent methods for distribution network reconfiguration, DG placement, and sizing that are intended to minimize power losses and improve the voltage profile.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a method for enhancing the stability of a dc distribution system that integrates plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) with an ac power grid. The dc distribution system is interfaced with the host ac grid via a voltage-sourced converter and can also embed photovoltaic (PV) modules. Thus, bidirectional dc-dc electronic power converters act as battery chargers and interface the PHEVs with the dc distribution system, while PV modules are interfaced with the dc distribution system via unidirectional dc-dc converters. The dc distribution system is expected to be more efficient and economical than a system of ac-dc battery chargers directly interfaced with an ac grid, but it is prone to instabilities due to the constant-power property of the dc-dc converters. Using a nonlinear control strategy, the proposed stability enhancement method mitigates the issue of instability by altering the power setpoints of the battery chargers, bidirectional dc-dc converters, without a need for changing system parameters or hardware. The paper presents mathematical models for the original and modified systems and demonstrates that the proposed technique expands the stable operating region of the dc distribution system. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for a study system in the PSCAD/EMTDC software environment.},

abstract = {The installed capacity of photovoltaic (PV) systems globally reached 177 GW at the end of 2014. The annual rate of installations, 38.7 GW in 2014, continues to increase. A large part of this is installed as residential systems connected to low voltage (LV) networks. The majority of the LV distribution networks are radial, unbalanced with respect to loads and feeder structures and have high R/X ratios. The large scale deployment of PV within the LV distribution networks is limited by voltage quality problems, particularly over voltages and unbalance. Development of proper mitigation techniques is essential to effectively and efficiently manage high penetration of PV within the LV distribution networks. A number of techniques have already been developed and implemented in LV distribution networks to alleviate those problems. This paper provides an extensive review of the present status, impacts and technical challenges of PV penetration in LV distribution networks. In addition, the review comprehensively examines the commercially available and emerging mitigation methods and provides a framework that systematically explores the full range of technical methods and limitations for PV impact mitigation. These will provide a useful framework and strong point of reference for the researchers working further in this field.},

In this paper the authors proposed a microgrid structure which consists of a detailed photovoltaic (PV) array model, a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) and various loads. Real and reactive power (PQ) control and droop control are developed for microgrid operation. In grid-connected mode, PQ control is developed by controlling the active and reactive power output of DGs in accordance with assigned references. Two PI controllers were used in the PQ controller, and a novel heuristic method, artificial bee colony (ABC), was adopted to tune the PI parameters. DGs can be controlled by droop control both under grid-connected and islanded modes. Droop control implements power reallocation between DGs based on predefined droop characteristics whenever load changes or the microgrid is connected/disconnected to the grid, while the microgrid voltage and frequency is maintained at appropriate levels. Through voltage, frequency, and power characteristics in the simulation under different scenarios, the proposed control strategies have demonstrated to work properly and effectively. The simulation results also show the effectiveness of tuning PI parameters by the ABC.},

abstract = {This paper deals with grid synchronization and control of single-phase voltage source inverter in distributed generation (DG) systems using a multi-output adaptive filter. Besides the active power injection, the proposed control enables the inverter to compensate load harmonic and reactive currents based on the capacity of inverter. The currents to be compensated are obtained using a multi-output adaptive filter structure that operates on the principle of variable step size (VSS) least mean squares (LMS) algorithm. The main objective of VSS-LMS filter is to decompose the load current into harmonic and reactive current components and compute their RMS values. The currents extracted by the VSS-LMS filter are used in developing a flexible compensation based on load compensation factors. The load compensation factors are calculated based on the remaining capacity of the inverter and priority. Harmonic currents compensation is given first priority over the reactive currents. In addition to harmonic currents detection, the same VSS-LMS filter is used in developing a phase locked loop unit for synchronizing the inverter with fundamental point of common coupling (PCC) voltage. Synchronizing the DG inverter with fundamental PCC voltage would make the proposed control algorithm insensitive to grid voltage harmonics and frequency fluctuations. The feasibility and the efficacy of the proposed control algorithm are demonstrated using hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) based experiments.},

There has been a drive to explore flexible and extensible approaches to delivering enhanced active network management. One suitable approach is Multi-Agent System (MAS) technology that can provide a distributed solution to Smart Grid control. This paper focuses on the design and testing of a MAS able to deliver the ANM function, covering thermal constraint management as an initial application with the ability to integrate voltage control algorithms in the future. It is used to determine whether intelligent agents are the key to addressing these problems in ways that are flexible, extensible and robust.

The formulated multi-objective problem comprises of technical performance indices for real power loss, maximum branch current capacity, voltage deviation, environment impact reduction index; and economic index. The appropriate weighting factors for different indices has been decided by Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). To solve the developed formulation, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) based approach has been used and applied on a 51-bus distribution networks. Also, in order to validate the use of AHP, the prioritization to different indices leads to formation of four scenarios and results are obtained in terms of the technical, economic and environmental parameters.

The proposed technique uses information about the current operating condition incorporating only the voltage phasor measurements and the power system's topology. The proposed index has been evaluated on the IEEE 30-bus and 118-bus test systems, considering several operating conditions and contingencies as line outages. The validation of the proposed index was performed by comparing it to other referenced voltage stability indexes. Simulation results show that the proposed index gives a good indication of the voltage stability of a power system; it is also simple and computationally less expensive than the indices it was compared to. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The continuous increasing penetration of Distributed Generation systems (DGs) into Distribution Networks (DNs) puts in evidence the necessity to develop innovative control strategies capable to maximize DGs active power production. This paper focuses the attention upon this problem, developing an innovative decentralized voltage control approach aimed to allow DGs active power production maximization and to avoid DGs disconnection due to voltage limit infringements as much as possible. In particular, the work presents a local reactive/active power management control strategy based on Neural Networks (NNs), able to regulate voltage profiles at buses where DGs are connected, taking into account their capability curve constraints. The Neural Network controller is based on the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm incorporated in the back-propagation learning algorithm used to train the NN. Simulations run on a real Medium Voltage (MV) Italian radial DN have been carried out to validate the proposed approach. The results prove the advantages that the flexibility of the proposed control strategy can have on voltage control performances, generation hosting capacity of the network and energy losses reduction. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {— This paper proposes the online reconfiguration of active distribution networks. The control of the active/reactive output power of distributed generation (DG) units combined with the control of remote controlled switches are employed in order to minimize DG curtailment, alleviate lines congestion, and mitigate voltage rise issues due to DG integration. Convex relaxations of the ac power flow equations and mixed integer linear disjunctive formulations are adopted to the optimization model in order to obtain fast and optimal solutions using standard branch and bound solvers. The computation burden of the optimization procedure is drastically reduced by exploiting the assessment of switching actions, which is performed using multiple load/generation scenarios. The effectiveness of the pro-posed optimization model is verified using different distribution test systems. Note to Practitioners—This work is motivated by the need for advanced network control and automation tools for the effective operation of power distribution networks with high dis-tributed generation (DG) integration. The increasing penetration of variable DG, e.g., wind turbines and photovoltaics, can cause overvoltages and/or feeder overloads. To deal with these issues, current studies examine the control of the DG active and reactive power. DG curtailment is very effective to deal with voltage rise issues; however, it has financial consequences for DG owners and this can be a barrier to further DG penetration. This paper introduces a convex model for the online reconfiguration of active distribution networks that minimizes DG curtailment, relieves line congestion, and improves voltage profile. The proposed convex optimization model is applied to different distribution test systems. The results show that the application of the network reconfiguration as an active network management scheme can eliminate DG curtailment, which means that the exploitation of DG output power into the network is maximized.

However, existing distribution systems were not designed considering large-scale penetration of DG. Due to the increasing penetration of DG, several technical challenges may arise which include voltage control, power quality and protection issues, etc. Therefore, additional components need to be modelled together with conventional distribution system components in order to study the impact of DG on the distribution system. The first objective of this paper is to review the required models of system components, the impacts of DG on system operation, mitigation of challenges, associated standards and regulations for the successful operation of distribution systems. A number of commercial and open source tools are available for modelling and analysis of distribution systems. An ideal computational tool should include necessary functionalities to study the impacts of increased DG penetration as well as various options to overcome possible operational problems. Based on the first objective, the second objective is to make a summary of characteristics and features that an ideal computational tool should have to study increased DG penetration. A comparison study of two commonly used computational tools is also carried out in this paper.},

  abstract = {During the last years the amount of electricity generated by Distributed Energy Resources (DER), especially wind turbines, has been increasing a lot. These Distributed Generation (DG) units are often connected to rural distribution networks, where they have a large impact on the voltage and the network losses. The network voltage at the customers point of connection is an important quality criteria and has to follow different standards as e.g. EN 50160. Therefore the voltage change caused by the integration of production units in the distribution network is an important aspect when integrating more DG in distribution networks and often a limiting factor for the maximum DG capacity which is possible to integrate into an existing network without reinforcement. Using the available voltage band more efficient by applying coordinated voltage control is a possibility to increase the hosted DG capacity in an existing distribution network without reinforcement of the network. To get the actual network status the new generation of electricity meters, which have the feasibility to communicate real time voltage measurements from the customers side to a network controller, give some benefits to a more flexible and coordinated voltage control in the network. The voltage range in the network will be used adapted to the actual load and generation situation instead of using worst case assumptions as it is good practice until now. A main part of the voltage control in medium voltage distribution networks is done by the on-load tap changer (OLTC) which takes the voltage at the consumers point of connection into account. A generic 10 kV distribution network with three typical types of feeders, as pure load, pure generation and mixed load and generation feeder, has been outlined. Coordinated voltage control is implemented by a central voltage controller. Simulations on the voltage and the network losses have been done and will be presented in this paper. The maximum DG capacity in the -$\backslash$n-$\backslash$ntest system increases most when introducing coordinated control of the OLTC but also the use of reactive power adds some benefit. Further increase of the DG capacity by more extensive use of curtailment is always possible but due to economical aspects not favoured.},

The aim was to minimize the losses and operation costs with only DG reactive power compensation with respect to voltage constraints. Thus, the active power flows are not affected as any attempt of active power curtailment causes financial loss for DG owner. The advantage of technologies that build up new smart grids is the possibility of developing new approaches of network management. In this paper, a coordinated reactive power control is presented which takes advantage of real-time data measurements from the network. The load-flow algorithm is implemented into the coordinated control, which determines the optimal operating point using a modeled network for every generator separately. The aim of the algorithm is to minimize the reactive power flow. The solution is evaluated by means of computer simulations. The simulated network is a part of the Slovenian medium-voltage distribution network. The presented results illustrate that the algorithm results in fast, simple and efficient energy loss allocation with an acceptable level of accuracy. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

This issue is at present under discussion by several national and international standardization bodies and the general trend is to require, for the new connections of generators to medium and low voltage grids, their participation to the reactive power network management. In this paper a novel strategy proposes to control the network voltage unbalance suitably for coordinating single and three-phase inverter interfaced embedded generators, concurrently with a local volt/var regulation action as foreseen by the new grid connection requirements. Simulations conducted on case study network representing a typical Italian 4-wire LV distribution system under different load/generation conditions, demonstrate that the coordinated action of single-phase and three-phase inverters may considerably reduce the degree of unbalance thus improving the network power quality levels. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {This study presents a control method to regulate load voltage and system frequency during microgrid islanding in a multi-area multi-microgrid (MMG) system. In the event of islanding of a microgrid from the distribution grid in the proposed MMG system, load voltage of the islanded microgrid and system frequency are affected. To overcome these problems, a control system for the MMG system is proposed. The proposed control system facilitates desired power exchange between grid-connected and islanded microgrids, and achieves effective voltage and frequency regulation in the MMG system. The main significance of the proposed MMG system is that multiple microgrids in different locations can be interconnected to meet larger bulk power demands. This ensures improved reliability and security of power supply in the MMG system. An improved model predictive control (MPC) algorithm is used to regulate various parameters such as output voltage, frequency and power of the inverters in the MMG system. The proposed MMG system is tested during islanding and load shedding using simulation studies. The simulation studies show that the inverters can operate effectively using MPC to provide the desired voltage, frequency and power during islanding and load shedding.},

The method is designed to be tractable for large grids of any type, e.g., meshed or radial. It can be used as a decision-making tool by distribution system operators which need to decide whether to invest in new hardware, such as new lines and transformers, or to initiate control measures influencing the operational costs. In this paper, active power curtailment and reactive power control are taken into account as measures to prevent unacceptable voltage rises as well as element overloads, as these allow postponing network investments. A low-voltage, meshed grid with 27 nodes is used to demonstrate the proposed scheme. In this particular case, the results show that by using control measures, an active distribution system operator can defer investments and operate the existing infrastructure more efficiently. The methodology is able to account for variations in operational and investment costs coming from regulatory influences to provide an insight to the most cost-efficient decision.},

In addition, in a power distribution system, a converter can lead to local instabilities when interacting with other dynamic subsystems. In this paper, to investigate the stability of system, the impedance-based small-signal model of each of the subsystem is respectively achieved and then an active control technique is proposed to stabilize the system.

With the snowballing of power demand by the consumers and also the restricted amount of power sources, therefore, the system has to perform at its maximum proficiency. Consequently, the noteworthy to discover the maximum ability boundary prior to voltage collapse should be undertaken. A preliminary warning can be perceived to evade the interruption of power system's capacity. This paper considered the implementation of real-time system monitoring methods that able to provide a timely warning in the power system before the voltage collapse occurred. Numerous types of line voltage stability indices (LVSI) are differentiated in this paper to resolve their effectuality to determine the weakest lines for the power system. The line voltage stability indices are assessed using the IEEE 9-Bus and IEEE 14-Bus Systems to validate their practicability. Besides that, this paper also introduced the implementation of real-time voltage stability monitoring by using Artificial Neural Network (ANN). Results demonstrated that the calculated indices and the estimated indices by using ANN are practically relevant in predicting the manifestation of voltage collapse in the system. Therefore, essential actions can be taken by the operators in order to dodge voltage collapse incident from arising.},

@article{Casavola2017,
abstract = {— High penetration of distributed generation (DG) in medium voltage (MV) power grids may easily lead to abrupt voltage raises in the presence of either low demand conditions or high power production from renewable sources. In order to cope with the possibly occurring voltage limit violation, the active power injected by the distributed generators is typically curtailed, being, however, such an approach suboptimal from an economical point of view and presenting several other disadvantages. To address this issue, the online management and coordination of the reactive power injected/absorbed by the distributed generators acting on the grid are proposed here. The approach is based on command governor ideas that are used here to optimally solve constrained voltage control problems in both centralized and distributed ways. The approach foresees an active coordination between some controllable devices of the grid, e.g., distributed generators and MV/high voltage transformers, in order to maintain relevant system variables within prescribed operative constraints in response to unexpected adverse conditions. Simulation results show that the proposed approach is more effective than approaches suggested by the current Italian norms on DGs connection. Note to Practitioners—The voltage control problem in distribu-tion power grids has gained new attention recently for the growth of the distributed generation (DG) penetration. The well-known " fit{\&}forget " policy, considered in the past in typical distribution networks where the presence of DG plants was limited and the power-flow inversion events far to happen, is no more reliable because it does not match the increasing need of distributed generators. For this reason, on one hand, in order to avoid critical operations of the network, new and more sophisticated methodologies are required. On the other hand, modern DG plants have been providing with inverters capable to be remotely controlled. Modern inverters have the potential to inject/absorb reactive power to/from grid to help in shaping the voltage profiles in their distribution feeders. This new scenario paves the way to novel control strategies applicable to distribution networks, which would allow a more effective voltage control in the presence of a greater penetration of DGs. By exploiting these new features, this paper proposes a novel power distribution management based on the coordination of the on-load tap changer (OLTC) transformer and the DGs operations that allow DGs to significantly increase their economical profitability and feeders to maintain the voltage profiles always under the prescribed limits. Both centralized and distributed algorithms are presented here. Their actions consist in the determination and transmission, via communication network, of the optimal set points for the OLTC (main bus voltage) and for the DGs (active and reactive power) in response to various (adverse) conditions represented, e.g., by critical increments of the voltages on the nodes of the network. The proposed approach can be of interest for the electricity distribution companies, because it is shown by simulations to be more effective than the reactive power management approaches proposed in the current Italian norms, that are based on precomputed maps, in regulating the voltage profiles on the DG connections.},

The optimization problem considers BESS capacity and installation points in the distribution system as decision variables. Each BESS operation is determined using a linear programming (LP) routine that minimizes the daily coincident peak demand. A comprehensive validation study is carried out through exhaustive enumeration with the IEEE 8500-Node test feeder showing that the proposed method results in consistent decisions that appear to be globally optimal.

abstract = {Distribution systems are subject to increasing penetration of dispersed generation. The energy injections of the generators impact on many technical issues, including energy losses occurring in the grid. Given the technical and economic importance of losses, several statistical approaches are proposed in the literature to evaluate the effects of dispersed generation on the energy lost in distribution networks. In principle, these approaches require a great number of load flow calculations. This paper provides a novel index aiming to avoid complex and computationally expensive statistical analysis for loss assessment. Such an index does not require any detailed characterisation of the energy flows over the network (load flow calculations). The performance of the index is tested using a model of a real medium voltage network in a wide set of generation scenarios. Each scenario is defined by a Monte Carlo algorithm that was developed ad hoc for this study. Moreover, advanced convergence criteria are provided to optimise the number of scenarios to process. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract  = {A model-based decentralized control design and analysis is presented for varying topology ac autonomous microgrids. Particularly, the proposed method is developed on a modular form by considering local control schemes for each distributed generation (DG) region as it is formulated by a distributed energy resource (DER) among with its controlled power electronic interface and a local load. Each DG region is driven locally by a droop-based outer-loop slow control scheme in cascaded-mode with inner-loop fast current controllers. The proposed inner-loop current controllers are of simple proportional-integral (PI) type and do not involve the standard used parameter-depended decoupling terms. A general method of integrating the different DG regions, with their inner-loop fast controllers involved, is deployed to include any distribution network connecting the DG regions to each other and to external loads. To confront the challenging issue of proving stability and convergence to the desired equilibrium of such a complex, decentralized controlled microgrid, an advanced Lyapunov-based technique is effectively applied on the model constructed. Hence, the main novelty of the present approach is that it can be used as a flexible general tool, independently from the system scaling, parameters, operating conditions and the intermittent nature of the different DERs, since the modular and open model-based analysis enables expandability to any microgrid structure instead of considering all the DG units being connected in parallel or in a common bus. The overall scheme is evaluated by examining a typical stand-alone microgrid and the results verify the theoretical analysis indicating stability and smooth system performance without adverse impacts between the different parts.},

Three types of agents - distribution system agent, estimator agent, and control agent are developed within the multi-agent framework. The agents simultaneously coordinated their activities through the online information and energy flow. The overall achievement of the proposed scheme depends on the coordination between two tasks - (i) estimation of reactive power using voltage variation formula and (ii) necessary control actions to provide the estimated reactive power to the distribution networks through the distributed static synchronous compensators. A linear quadratic regulator with a proportional integrator is designed for the control agent in order to control the reactive component of the current and the DC voltage of the compensators. The performance of the proposed scheme is tested on a 10-bus power distribution network under various scenarios. The effectiveness is validated by comparing the proposed approach to the conventional proportional integral control approach. It is found that, the agent-based scheme provides excellent robust performance under various operating conditions of the power distribution network.},

abstract = {In Low Voltage (LV) distribution networks, the high volatility of distributed photovoltaic (PV) generation has a severe impact on the variation of operation indices, in steady state conditions. During periods with high PV injection and low demand, LV feeders are more and more subject to overvoltage events and temporary PV units' cut-offs. As a result, the delivered power quality is affected and network operational expenses increase. Moreover, the income of the PV owner is decreased due to the loss of generated energy. For efficiently addressing such operational issues, long term observability analytics of the LV network are required. Distribution System Operators (DSOs) currently deploy such studies in a deterministic manner, focusing on "worst-case" hypothesis, without considering the uncertainty of nodal power injection and consumption. This approach can lead to over restrictive decisions and costly technical solutions. For refining DSO strategies to the variability of network states, probabilistic methods are highly recommended. In this context, this paper presents a Monte-Carlo (MC) framework that simulates the steady operation of the LV network by elaborating user-specific smart metering (SM) measurements. The presented framework integrates a complete three-phase power flow algorithm that can analyse most possible LV network configurations, balanced and unbalanced, considering nodal power injections and consumptions as random variables of each network state. Such unbalanced power flow algorithms had not up to now been linked with probabilistic analysis using network-specific SM readings. For demonstrating the interest of the proposed framework, the latter is used to simulate several configurations in an existing LV feeder with high PV integration and SM deployment.},

abstract = {? 2016 IEEE.With the emerging of small-scale integrated energy systems (IESs), there are significant potentials to increase the functionality of a typical demand-side management (DSM) strategy and typical implementation of building-level distributed energy resources (DERs). By integrating DSM and DERs into a cohesive, networked package that fully utilizes smart energy-efficient end-use devices, advanced building control/automation systems, and integrated communications architectures, it is possible to efficiently manage energy and comfort at the end-use location. In this paper, an ontology-driven multi-agent control system with intelligent optimizers is proposed for optimal real-time dispatch of an integrated building and microgrid system considering coordinated demand response (DR) and DERs management. The optimal dispatch problem is formulated as a mixed integer nonlinear programing problem (MINLP) and solved through an agent-based approach. Several computer simulations are also presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach over the conventional methods.},

abstract = {? 2016 The Institution of Engineering and Technology.Owing to the increasing penetration of single-phase small generation units and electric vehicles connected to distribution grids, system operators are facing challenges related to local unbalanced voltage rise or drop issues, which may lead to a violation of the allowed voltage band. To address this problem, distribution transformers with on-load tapping capability are under development. This study presents model and experimental validation of a 35 kVA three-phase power distribution transformer with independent on-load tap-changer control capability on each phase. With the purpose of investigating and evaluating its effectiveness under different operative conditions, appropriate scenarios are defined and tested considering both balanced and unbalanced situations, also in case of reverse power flow. The experimental setup is built starting from an analysis of a Danish distribution network, in order to reproduce the main feature of an unbalanced grid. The experimental activities are recreated in by carrying out dynamics simulation studies, aiming at validating the implemented models of both the transformer as well as the other grid components. Phase-neutral voltages' deviations are limited, proving the effectiveness of the phase-independent tap operations. Furthermore, minor deviations of the results from simulations and experiments confirm that all the system components have been properly modelled.},

abstract = {This paper attempts to present the state of art of research work carried out on the optimal planning of distributed generation (DG) systems under different aspects. There are number of important issues to be considered while carrying out studies related to the planning and operational aspects of DG. The planning of the electric system with the presence of DG requires the definition of several factors, such as: the best technology to be used, the number and the capacity of the units, the best location, the type of network connection, etc. The impact of DG in system operating characteristics, such as electric losses, voltage profile, stability and reliability needs to be appropriately evaluated. For that reason, the use of an optimization method capable of indicating the best solution for a given distribution network can be very useful for the system planning engineer, when dealing with the increase of DG penetration that is happening nowadays. The selection of the best places for installation and the preferable size of the DG units in large distribution systems is a complex combinatorial optimization problem. This paper aims at providing a review of the relevant aspects related to DG and its impact that DG might have on the operation of distributed networks. This paper covers the review of basics of DG, DG definition, current status of DG technologies, potential advantages and disadvantages, review for optimal placement of DG systems, optimizations techniques/methodologies used in optimal planning of DG in distribution systems. An attempt has been made to judge that which methodologies/techniques are suitable for optimal placement of DG systems based on the available literature and detail comparison(s) of each one. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

As such, this paper presents the incorporation of SVRs in a generic droop-based three-phase power flow algorithm of IMGs.

However, in stand-alone systems with multiple distributed energy storage units, the conventional droop methods are unable to control the storage unit state-of-charge (SOC) in order to change simultaneously. Existing techniques endeavor to solve this problem by changing the slope of the P-f curve however this solution compromises the power response performance. As an alternative, this paper proposes a new SOC-based droop control, whereby the P-f curve is shifted either upwards or downwards according to the battery SOC. The proposed technique makes it possible to select the time constant for the battery SOC convergence and, at the same time, to optimize the power response performance. The paper also shows how the SOC changes when the ratios between the battery capacity and the inverter rated power are different and how the proposed technique can limit the SOC imbalance.

Solar energy is the most prominent among renewable sources, as it is an inexhaustible resource and its exploitation has thus far been ecologically friendly. The potential amount of solar energy is considerably greater than current worldwide energy demands. Solar energy has been developing more rapidly than the other renewable energy sources for the last few decades. The best way to harvest the sun's power is photovoltaic (PV) technology. This paper presents a study on solar energy in the form of a stand-alone and hybrid power generation system used to electrify off-grid locations. The stand-alone solar-PV system developed here is intended to be used to power a single house or a small community and it also functions as a mini-grid, generating power in places where adequate solar radiation is available throughout the year. However, many places throughout the world experience unsteady amounts of solar radiation and in those places, a hybrid solar-PV system is the most efficient solution for electrification. The main benefit of the hybrid system is that the weakness of one source is covered by the other source.

The operating result so far showed that the combined control rule of voltage and reactive power compensation according to the load compensation method by microcomputer is correct and reasonable. It can follow the variation of load to automatically determine the reasonable voltage that has to be maintained. The accuracy of voltage regulation can achieve 0.5{\%} and that of reactive compensation is 5{\%}. Its application can not only improve the voltage quality of power system, but also decrease loss of electric energy. The economic benefit is obvious. },

abstract = {The transformation of the electrical energy system with traditional central power generation into a system of high penetration of distributed generation, requires a change in the current system operation practices. It is expected that a significant number of central power plants, which traditionally provided most ancillary services, will be taken out of operation during the next decades. From a technical and economic perspective, this paper evaluates the potential of reactive power provision from the distribution grid to the transmission grid. This approach is compared to reactive power provision from conventional dynamic reactive power compensators regarding technical and economic aspects. It will be shown that distributed generators can provide reactive power while being cost-competitive to conventional techniques. ? 2013 IEEE.},

abstract = {The coordinated operation of distributed energy re- sources such as storage and generation units and also loads is re- quired for the reliable operation of an islandedmicrogrid. Since in islanded microgrids the storage units are commonlyresponsible for regulating the voltage amplitude and frequency in the local power system, the coordination should consider safe operating limits for the stored energy, which prevents fast degradation or dam- age to the storage units. This paper proposes a centralized con- trol architecture, applicable for local area power systems such as a small-scale microgrid. The centralized architecture is based on three supervisory control tasks which consider: active power cur- tailment of generation for avoiding overcharge of the storage units, load shedding actions for preventing deep discharge of the stor- age units, and equalization of the state of charge (SoC) among distributed storage systems for avoiding uneven degradation. The proposed equalizationmethod has proved to be effective for equal- izing the SoC of distributed energy storage systems and for en- suring uniform charge/discharge ratios regardless of differences in the capacity of the storage units. Additionally, the strategy is com- plemented with an optimal scheduling of load connection, which minimizes the connection and disconnection cycles of the loads within a time horizon of 24 h. The proposed architecture is veri- fied experimentally in a lab-scale prototype of a microgrid, which has real communication between the microgrid and the central controller.},

Wind power, particularly at higher penetration levels, introduces various grid issues, with frequency and voltage stability being particularly critical concerns. Voltage dip induced frequency stability following a network fault in such systems is one potential risk that has so far received limited attention by the research community. With state of the art modelling, the potential impact of a delayed active power recovery from wind generation following a network fault induced voltage dip is investigated. The subsequent voltage oscillations introduced by wind turbines, exacerbating frequency stability, are also examined.

abstract = {This paper presents a planning model and an active network management (ANM) scheme for increasing small-scale renewable distributed generation (DG) capacity in distribution networks. The capacity of each DG unit is assumed to include two components: 1) unconditional and 2) conditional. Unconditional DG capacity is calculated using an appropriate economic model that ensures adequate profit for DG investors. For all online distribution system conditions, a DG unit whose capacity is less than or equal to the unconditional DG capacity is granted permission to inject power into the system without curtailment. The first phase of this work involved the development of a proposed planning model that maximizes the number of DG units installed based on the calculated unconditional capacity. Any capacity higher than the unconditional DG capacity is considered conditional capacity. The second phase of this work is focused on an ANM scheme for minimizing the curtailment of conditional DG capacity using a novel scalable optimization model. The simulation results show that the proposed planning model with the ANM scheme significantly increases the photovoltaic (PV) DG capacity that can be installed. The simulation results indicate that online operation of the proposed ANM scheme would provide a favorable outcome and enhanced performance.},

Since GA is a metaheuristic algorithm, the results of multiple runs are taken and the statistical variations for locations and generations for DG units are shown. The locations and sizes for DG units obtained with fuzzy-based approach are found to be different than those obtained with deterministic approach. The results obtained with fuzzy-based approach are found to be comparatively efficient in working with future load growth.

The chapter highlights the basic precepts of power and frequency control, voltage control, and load balancing and provides a basic understanding of the reactive compensation of loads. In an ideal AC power system, the voltage and frequency at every supply point are constant and free from harmonics, and the power factor is in union. In particular, these parameters will be independent of the size and characteristics of consumers' loads. In an ideal system, each load is designed for optimum performance at a given supply voltage, rather than for merely adequate performance over an unpredictable range of voltage. In three-phase systems, the phase currents and voltages are balanced. The stability of the system against oscillations and faults should be assured. Thus, all these criteria add up to a notion of power quality.},

Their intermittent nature makes it very difficult to predict power output, thus either additional reserve power plants or new storage and control technologies are required. Traditional spinning reserve cannot fully compensate sudden changes in renewable energy power generation. Using new storage technologies such as flow batteries, it is feasible to balance the variations in power and voltage within very short period of time. This paper summarises the controlled use of hybrid flow battery, thermal and hydro power plant system, to support wind power plants to reach near perfect balance, i.e. make the total power output as close as possible to the predicted value. It also investigates the possibility of such technology to take part in the balance of the Lithuanian power system. A dynamic model of flow battery is demonstrated where it evaluates the main parameters such as power, energy, reaction time and efficiency. The required battery size is tested based on range of thermal and hydro power plant reaction times. This work suggests that power and energy of a reasonable size flow battery is sufficient to correct the load and wind power imbalance.},

In this paper, these research efforts were categorized, discussed and analyzed to evaluate where we currently stand on the migration path from the overwhelming fully AC power system to a more flexible hybrid AC/DC power system. Moreover, the impediments against more deployment of DC distribution systems and some of the proposed solutions to overcome those impediments in the literature will be discussed.

abstract = {Optimal Integration of Distributed Generation (DG) in distribution grid is one of the important and effective options. Optimal allocation with a suitable sizing of DG units play efficient role in reducing operating cost and power losses in additional to improving voltage stability which are considered in optimization objective function. In this paper, a new effective and powerful optimization algorithm is produced. A novel hybrid particle swarm (HPSO) with Quasi-Newton (QN) algorithm is proposed to solve the problem of DG location and sizing distribution systems satisfying the operation constraints. In this paper, two stages are introduced. First, the loss sensitivity analysis is employed to select the most appropriate candidate DG placement. Then, a novel hybrid particle swarm optimization (HPSO) algorithm is implemented to find optimal sizing of DGs and their settings from the selected buses. The proposed algorithm has been tested on 33-bus, and 69-bus IEEE standard radial distribution systems under multi distributed generator types. In order to validate the proposed approach, the obtained results have been compared with other algorithms such as Genetic Algorithm (GA), Particle Swarm Algorithm (PSO), Novel combined Genetic Algorithm and Particle Swarm Optimization (GA/PSO), Simulation Annealing Algorithm (SA), and Bacterial Foraging Optimization Algorithm (BFOA). The numerical results have been proved the capability with good performance of the proposed approach to find the optimal solutions. Numerical results have been obtained by MATLAB package.},

abstract = {The use of distributed generation is growing steadily, motivating a need for flexible interconnection strategies. The resulting microgrid concept allows sub-networks of sources and loads to maintain reliable operation when disconnected from the main grid. The paper presents a control strategy for inverter-based sources that supports transitioning between grid connection and autonomous operation. The controller regulates the inverter terminal voltage and the active power delivered to the AC system, and takes into account the phase-locked loop (PLL) dynamics. An example, in which two SOFC plants provide power to a microgrid, explores controller behaviour. The investigation considers disconnection from the main grid, autonomous operation, and re-synchronization with the main grid.},

But, this technology arises a lot of challenges which are necessary to be taken care of for smooth operation of the network. Voltage regulation is the most significant technical challenge that tends to limit the amount of penetration of renewable distribution generators (DGs) into the distribution network. This paper attempts to present a detailed review of the control strategies that are being utilized to mitigate voltage regulation challenges when increased amount of renewable DGs are connected within the distribution network. This study analyses the direct impacts of increased accommodation of renewable DGs on the distribution network operation and evaluates current research status of voltage control strategies. Then qualitative analysis is performed for all kinds of voltage control approaches involving their pros and cons for the first time. The objective of this contribution is to present the latest research status of distribution system voltage control strategies with highly penetrated renewable DGs and a brief review of different control methodologies.},
